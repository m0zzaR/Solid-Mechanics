# CE30/ME85 – Introduction to Solid Mechanics
**University of California, Berkeley**  
**Instructor: Prof. S. Li**

## Class Summary
The purpose of CE30/ME85 is to provide students with a solid foundation in the principles of solid mechanics, focusing on the analysis of forces, moments, and the behavior of materials under various types of loading. This course emphasizes both theoretical development and practical problem-solving skills.

## Textbook
The following textbook is required for the course:
- **Ferdinand P. Beer, E. Russell Johnston, Jr., John T. DeWolf, and David F. Mazurek**, *Statics and Mechanics of Materials*, 3rd Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2021.

## Topics

The following is a tentative week-by-week topic list:
